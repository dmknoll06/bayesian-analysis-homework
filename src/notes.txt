Bayesian inference
 - updating your beliefs after considering new evidence, in a structured way
 - frequentist probablility is about the long run frequency of events, e.g. poker drawing odds
 - bayesians interpret probablitiy as a measure of belief or confidence of an event occurring

Sample sizes are never large. Once N is large enough, generally you're just subdividing the data and trying to solve the next problem

Most Big data problems are solved by simple algorithms today. e.g. least squares linear regression, LASSO regression, EM algorithm. Difficulties are mainly computational, storage and execution challenges.

The most difficult analytics problems involve medium and small data. not-quite-big-enough datasets.
